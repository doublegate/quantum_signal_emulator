## Overview

The Quantum Signal Emulator is an advanced research tool designed for hardware developers and emulator creators who need to understand the precise timing behavior of classic video game systems. By combining quantum-inspired algorithms with machine learning techniques, it provides unprecedented insight into hardware signals, register states, and timing relationships.

This tool doesn't just emulate classic hardware - it analyzes it at the quantum level, offering insights that traditional emulators cannot provide.

## Key Features

- **Quantum-Inspired Analysis**: Leverages quantum computing principles to reconstruct and analyze hardware signals with unprecedented precision
- **Cycle-Accurate Timing**: Measures and validates cycle-precise timing relationships between hardware components
- **ML-Enhanced Pattern Detection**: Uses machine learning to identify patterns in register usage and hardware behavior
- **Multi-System Support**: Analyzes NES, SNES, Genesis, and Atari 2600 hardware
- **Visual Analysis Tools**: Provides advanced visualizations of timing relationships, register states, and quantum metrics
- **Hardware Integration**: Imports data from real hardware captures and other emulators for comparison
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows for adding new systems and analysis techniques

qse-extract --rom game.nes --extract-type header
```

### Python API

```python
from quantum_signal_emulator.systems.system_factory import SystemFactory
from quantum_signal_emulator.analysis.quantum_analyzer import QuantumAnalyzer
from quantum_signal_emulator.common.visualizer import SignalVisualizer

# Create system
system = SystemFactory.create_system("nes")
system.load_rom("game.nes")

# Run simulation
system.reset()
system.run_frame()

# Analyze results
analyzer = QuantumAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_hardware_state(system.state_history)

# Visualize
visualizer = SignalVisualizer()
visualizer.plot_quantum_results(results)
```

## Supported Systems

The Quantum Signal Emulator currently supports the following classic video game systems:

| System | CPU | Resolution | Features |
|--------|-----|------------|----------|
| NES | 6502 (1.79 MHz) | 256×240 | PPU, APU, Cartridge mappers |
| SNES | 65C816 (3.58 MHz) | 256×224 | Mode 7, DSP, Multiple resolutions |
| Sega Genesis | 68000 (7.67 MHz) + Z80 (3.58 MHz) | 320×224 | VDP, YM2612, SN76489 |
| Atari 2600 | 6507 (1.19 MHz) | 160×192 | TIA, RIOT, Cycle-precise timing |

## Analysis Capabilities

The emulator provides three analysis modes:

1. **Basic Mode**: Traditional cycle-accurate analysis focusing on register states and timing relationships
2. **Quantum Mode**: Advanced analysis using quantum-inspired algorithms for deeper insight into signal behavior
3. **Hybrid Mode**: Combines both approaches for comprehensive analysis

### Signal Reconstruction

The system employs quantum-inspired algorithms to reconstruct analog signals from digital samples, achieving sub-cycle precision in timing reconstruction. It handles both analog and digital signals with high precision using multi-resolution wavelet analysis.

### Hardware State Analysis

The emulator tracks register states, memory access patterns, and bus transactions through quantum state tracking and classical state machine analysis. It maintains a quantum-enhanced state history capturing both explicit register values and implicit state dependencies.

### Timing Analysis

The system measures clock cycle precision using quantum-enhanced time measurement techniques, identifies timing anomalies through quantum-enhanced anomaly detection, and validates hardware synchronization using quantum-enhanced phase detection.
